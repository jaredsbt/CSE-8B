    // 1) You cannot create an R object because we use an R object as the parameter while defining the R constructor. We cannot use an object as the paramter for its own constructor definition since the constrcutor is not already defined. 
    // 2) Without changing the fields and keeping the same fields, you cannot reply to a reply tweet. I believe that there should be another constructor that takes in a ReplyTweet as a paramater instead of TextTweet in order to reply to a reply tweet.
